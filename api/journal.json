The main focus is on flex box, which is quite difficult until you start to really play with it. Additionally, we are learning how to manuipulate <a href='https://github.com/pour-theoil/Coffee-House-Nash'>.css files</a> to bring the site to life.",

The goal was to master git and github, implement flex box, and of course work as a team. The dynamics were not always easy, but we were able to come together to create a working html website with some interesting responsponsive characteristics!",

I had a couple of issues controlling the filter so that it would list all of the possible moods as well as then being able to see all of the posts again. Next steps... a little css refresh to react better to different screen sizes.",
